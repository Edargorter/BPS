# Chemical Batch Processing Simulator and Optimisation Experiments for Scheduling

Applying selected metaheuristics to the optimisation of the scheduling with respect to profit (amount of chemical(s) produced in a fixed length of time) and makespan (minimising process time for fixed amount of profit). The schedules' mathematical representations and formulation come from the first paper listed below.
